# GreytHR2WrikeReminder
While signing out from GreytHR, this extension will ensure that Wrike's timesheet page loads up and reminds users to fill the timesheet. It doesnt stop signout from happening but just alerts/reminds the user to fill the timesheet on time. Existing workflow of greytHR is not affected by this extension. The extension listens to sign out event and shows alerts and open Wrike.

FF uses Manifest v2 and Chrome uses v3
